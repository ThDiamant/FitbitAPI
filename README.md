# FitbitProject

In this project we use the Fitbit API to gather data from a Fitbit Sense that one of our team members wore, save the data to a MongoDB and then create some visualizations using Streamlit.

To do:
1) Parse the data as they are taken from the Fitbit API and bring them in a format that needs to be decided so that they are saved in MongoDB.
   For example, we need to think of what the time unit for the time series will be, we need to decided on the data types, etc.
2) Save the data in MongoDB.
3) Create 10 interactive visualizations with Streamlit.
